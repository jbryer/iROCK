My self-regulated learning survey results have shown me that I could always
improve my intelligence. The results of my survey have allowed me to see the
things I need to work on. For instance, our of reading, writing, and math,
writing could use the improvement the most. In that I have looked at the
strategies that I could use to improve my writing such as taking my writing
task and making smaller components, writing out an outline, research my topic I
am writing about, write my paper and then proofread and fix the mistakes. I
could also get someone to read and critique my work. I can always ask my
professor for feedback and really listen and understand the feedback that is
given. I could use it to figure out how I can do better the next time I have a
paper to write. Other than improving my writing, I can improve my test anxiety.
Some strategies I could use are relaxing when I get overwhelmed. Take a deep
breath and tell myself "I can do this" Giving myself the confidence I need to
do the task at hand. As I study for an upcoming test I can get others to quiz
me and see what I could study further on. I could prepare for studying by
myself, by comparing my notes to others in class. I could also use time
management, plan out when I should study, really allowing myself the time
needed to study. Lastly, I believe that I could improve on really asking myself
during assignments and test, if I am dong the best I can. Evaluating myself, by
asking if I am really focused on my assignment. Looking at the feedback and
seeing what I could do different the next time. Figuring out what type of
studying works best for me. I have really learned how I can improve my
intelligence. I have learned that I do not have to feel bad for seeking out
help with the task I struggle with. Overall, I have learned through taking this
survey that I can improve on all aspects of my intelligence.
