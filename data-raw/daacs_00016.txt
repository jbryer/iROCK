After taking the SRL survey, I have come to the realization that I need a lot
of improvement when it comes to school. First improvement is patience, while
doing this assignment here I really became irritated because the system to
login was acting up and I almost gave up. Secondly, being time sensitive, I
receive instructions to complete at task and I wait till the last minute to get
the job complete. When it comes to my writing skills since I have not had to
complete a writing project in 10 years or more, I have lost it all, when it
comes down to writing skills. I blame myself for the lack of writing skills, at
times I tend to write shortcuts like I am sending a text message to a friend.

Some after sitting home and thinking about my results this weekend. I have come
to the realization that I need a lot of improvement is needed when it comes to
school with me. Another realization is that if you do not use a skill that you
have learned for a long-time you lost the ability to be able to use later, so
for me I have not written any kind of essays in 10 years so now, when it is
time to use it, it takes a lot longer. So, to help myself I will be reading on
essay’s and how to properly write an essay. Writing an essay or research paper
can sometimes be a lot for the simple fact, there is a lot of critical thinking
involved and if you are not a critical thinker like myself then you are going
to need more time and effort to complete the task. One thing that really works
for me is writing down thoughts before writing. Listening to music also helps
me, I have come to that realization in my writing course. Writing is a great
way to express yourself at one point of time I use to love writing now since I
have not a reason to write an essay or just write I kind of lost the whole
concept. But, in the day to come I will become better at writing.
