The self-regulated learning survey results and the feedback suggests that I
have low self-efficiency for online learning. The survey said that improving my
self-efficiency is important because it will make me try harder, stay
persistent, and motivated. I think that the survey was right because during the
corona virus I struggled online. I looked up many answers on google rather than
trying to solve the problems by myself. I didn't retain information as much
because I was being taught through a screen and with being at home, I had many
distractions like my tv, my phone, and my bed. On most of the other points of
the survey, I received a 2 out of 3 as my score. The assessment also revealed
to me that I am very bad at managing time. Before I came to college, I never
used a calendar or agenda to manage my work because it took too long, but now I
do because the workload is heavier, so I needed a habit to help me manage
everything. I am also bad at putting my schoolwork first because I
procrastinate often. I usually wait until the last minute to complete my work
because I was always confident in my work. I think that college will be way
harder because I won't have as much leeway. One positive result is I am always
willing to seek help from teachers or others. I almost always ask questions
when I don't understand something, or I will look things up online to help me.
Some feedback that I will use this semester is evaluating myself after I have
completed my work. The assessment suggests that doing this can help me avoid
mistakes or help me recognize when I might have to adjust or change my work.
Some other feedback that I have already used is tracking my assignments with a
handwritten agenda. Most times I am very confident in math class, with my
reading and writing skills, and managing anxiety levels when it comes to test
taking. Taking the DAACS self-regulated learning survey has helped me realize
what I am good at and what I have to improve.
